# Object Detector â€“ Real-Time Detection Using YOLO ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¥

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,  
This repository contains a simple and clean object detection setup that I've been working on recently. It mainly uses **YOLO** with **OpenCV**, and supports both **webcam** and **video file** inputs.

The goal was to have something that just works â€” no unnecessary complexity, just a working detection pipeline that you can run, understand, and extend.

## ðŸ’» What's in here?

- Real-time object detection from webcam
- Object detection on video files
- YOLO model support (weights + cfg + class names)
- Draws bounding boxes with labels + confidence scores
- Scripts are kept short and understandable
